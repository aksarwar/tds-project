Data Scraping Process: Used Pythonâ€™s requests library to interact with the GitHub API, querying /search/users for Toronto-based developers by location and follower count, and gathering detailed profile and repository data using /users/{username} and /users/{username}/repos endpoints.

Interesting Finding: Analysis revealed that developers with moderate-length bios (10-20 words) and keywords like "AI" or "Data Science" attract more followers, possibly due to algorithmic boosts or increased community interest.

Actionable Recommendation: Developers should create concise bios that highlight key skills or trending fields like "machine learning" and maintain active repositories to improve visibility and attract followers.
